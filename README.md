# Lumen Microservice Example


Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

We recommend using [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead),
which comes with PHP 7.0, HHVM, Postgres, and Redis build in.
